# BARE
Ben's Advanced Recovery Environment. A small OS designed for recovery and fixing of Linux (And maybe other Unix) systems
Currently in beta

This system is based on Arch Linux x86_64. If demand arises I will create 32-bit and ARM versions

Currently only supports UEFI. Again, if demand arises, I will create a BIOS version.

I will release new versions every couple of weeks.

Release versions are structured as YY.WW (WW meaning the week number, so a release in the second week of 2022 will be 22.02)

Releases are named after US national parks and go alphabetically. If I run out, I will use other countries.

Commit any scripts you think would be helpful to fix a broken Linux system

Also commit any pictures of national parks that could be used as desktop wallpapers
