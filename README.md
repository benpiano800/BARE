# BARE
Ben's Advanced Recovery Environment. A small OS designed to be run from a USB stick for recovery and fixing of Linux (And maybe other Unix) systems

Currently in beta

This system is based on Arch Linux x86_64. If demand arises I will create 32-bit and ARM versions

Currently only supports UEFI. Again, if demand arises, I will create a BIOS version.

I will release new versions every couple of weeks.

Release versions are structured as YY.WW (WW meaning the week number, so a release in the second week of 2022 will be 22.02)

Releases are named after US national parks and go alphabetically. If I run out, I will use other countries.

Commit any scripts you think would be helpful to fix a broken Linux system

Also commit any pictures of national parks that could be used as desktop wallpapers

This system is subject to the GNU General Public License. Please see LICENSE file for details. 

# Installation
Installing BARE is simple. All you need is a USB stick of at least 8GB, the ISO image, and an image writing program such as dd.
Write the ISO to your USB and boot from it. That's all!
The image is persistant, so feel free to create your own files or whatever. However, there is currently no method of updating without re-formatting the USB, so keep that in mind.
